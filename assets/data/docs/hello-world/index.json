I met with Kristof and the team. Made some wonderful impression and closed of with a beautiful walk through the city center.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of what we are going to build here - a digital identity that is going to kick some centralized ass! The technology is already here, now it's time to link everything together and communicate it to the people to create interest and flow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-am-i-bringing-to-the-table\"><a href=\"#what-am-i-bringing-to-the-table\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What am I bringing to the table</h2>\n<p>I am here to put all my skills and energy together to create a bridge between the technical aspect and the common world. The time is now to enliven the Crystal Twin to it's full potential. This needs to be communicated in a interesting and fun way to investors and to developers. </p>\n<p>It is so important that people get back there digital sovereignity.
